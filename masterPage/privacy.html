	<h2>Information Collection and Use</h2>
	<p>This site logs the IP addresses and types of browser used by its guests. This information is used to monitor and make improvements to the site. This site does not secretly collect any personally identifiable information. User's may choose to become a registered user, in which case they may choose to reveal information about themselves such as their email address. This information will never be shared or sold. Users may remove themselves and their information from the web site's database by contacting us.</p>

	<h2>Cookies</h2>
	<p>A cookie is a small piece of data stored on the user's hard drive. This site uses cookies to keep you signed in and to maintain state between pages. The user may remove these cookies at any time by logging out of the web site.</p>

	<p>A cookie in no way gives us access to your computer or any information about you, other than the data you choose to share with us.</p>

	<p>You can choose to accept or decline cookies. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies. Declining cookies will prevent you from taking full advantage of the website.</p>


	<h2>Log Files</h2>
	<p>We use IP addresses and browser type to analyze trends and administer the site. We do not do reverse DNS lookups, so IP addresses are not linked to personally identifiable information.</p>


	<h2>Sharing</h2>
	<p>We may share aggregated information with our partners. This is not linked to any personally identifiable information.</p>

	<p>We will share personally identifiable information only when requested by a legal authority.</p>

	<p>There are many third-party applications that can sync with YouMix. If you choose to link your account with a third-party application, all of your information can be downloaded, read, modified and deleted by this third-party application as if it was you. YouMix is not responsible for the privacy policies or actions of any third-party application to which you have given access to your account.</p>


	<h2>Links</h2>
	<p>This web site contains links to other sites. Please be aware that we are not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site and to read the privacy statements of each and every web site that collects personally identifiable information. This privacy statement applies solely to information collected by this Web site.</p>


	<h2>Surveys and Contests</h2>
	<p>From time-to-time our site requests information from users via surveys. Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary and the user therefore has a choice whether or not to disclose this information. Information requested may include contact information (such as name and shipping address), and demographic information (such as zip code, age level). Survey information will be used for purposes of monitoring or improving the use and satisfaction of this site.</p>


	<h2>Security</h2>
	<p>This website takes precautions to protect our users' information. When users submit sensitive information via the website, your information is protected both online and off-line. While we use best practices to protect your data, we cannot guarantee that your data is completely secure. We recommend that you do not store confidential information on our servers and that you make regular backups of your data using our backup tools. If you have any questions about the security at our website, you can contact us.</p>


	<h2>Notification of Changes</h2>
	<p>If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes on this page, and notify our users, so that our users are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it. We will always use information in accordance with the privacy policy under which the information was collected.</p>
